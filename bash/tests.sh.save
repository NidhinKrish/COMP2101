# This is a script to practice doing testing in bash scripts

# This section demonstrates file testing

# Test for the existence of the /etc/resolv.conf file
# TASK 1: Add a test to see if the /etc/resolv.conf file is a regular file
# TASK 2: Add a test to see if the /etc/resolv.conf file is a symbolic link
# TASK 3: Add a test to see if the /etc/resolv.conf file is a directory
# TASK 4: Add a test to see if the /etc/resolv.conf file is readable
# TASK 5: Add a test to see if the /etc/resolv.conf file is writable
# TASK 6: Add a test to see if the /etc/resolv.conf file is executable

[ -x /etc/resolv.conf] && echo "/etc/resolv.conf IS EXECUTABLE" || echo "/etc/resolv.conf IS EXECUTABLE"
# Tests if /tmp is a directory
# TASK 4: Add a test to see if the /tmp directory is readable
# TASK 5: Add a test to see if the /tmp directory is writable
# TASK 6: Add a test to see if the /tmp directory can be accessed

# Tests if one file is newer than another
# TASK 7: Add testing to print out which file newest, or if they are the same age
[ ! /etc/hosts -nt /etc/resolv.conf -a ! /etc/hosts -ot /etc/resolv.conf ] && echo "/etc/hosts is the same age as /etc/resolv.conf"

# this section demonstrates doing numeric tests in bash

# TASK 1: Improve it by getting the user to give us the numbers to use in our tests
# TASK 2: Improve it by adding a test to tell the user if the numbers are even or odd
# TASK 3: Improve it by adding a test to tell the user is the second number is a multiple of the first number
echo "enter first number"
read firstNumber
echo "enter second number"
read secondNumber

[ $firstNumber -eq $secondNumber ] && echo "The two numbers are the same"
[ $firstNumber -ne $secondNumber ] && echo "The two numbers are not the same"
[ $firstNumber -lt $secondNumber ] && echo "The first number is less than the second number"
[ $firstNumber -gt $secondNumber ] && echo "The first number is greater than the second number"

[ $firstNumber -le $secondNumber ] && echo "The first number is less than or equal to the second number"
[ $firstNumber -ge $secondNumber ] && echo "The first number is greater than or equal to the second number"

# This section demonstrates testing variables

# Test if the USER variable exists
# TASK 1: Add a command that prints out a labelled description of what is in the USER variable, but only if it is not empty
# TASK 2: Add a command that tells the user if the USER variable exists, but is empty
[ -v USER ] && echo "The variable SHELL exists"

# Tests for string data
# TASK 3: Modify the command to use the != operator instead of the = operator, without breaking the logic of the command
# TASK 4: Use the read command to ask the user running the script to give us strings to use for the tests
echo "enter a number"
read a
echo "ENter AnOTHER number"
read b
b=01
[ $a = $b ] && echo "$a is alphanumerically equal to $b" || echo "$a is not alphanumerically equal to $b"
